Test Plan:
1. Introduction

  1.1 Purpose:
    The purpose of this test plan is to test the category and subcategories of  ”Pomôcky” on the navigation bar for  https://www.slsp.sk/sk/ludia.

  1.2 Scope:
    This test plan covers E2E testing of the website: https://www.slsp.sk/sk/ludia
    The testing will include both manual and automated tests.

2. Test Items
  Category ”Pomôcky”
  Subcategories of category “Pomôcky”
  
3. Features to be Tested
  Category functionality
  Subcategories functionality
  Navigation between subcategories
  Visibility of tested feature

4. Features Not to be Tested
 Client centrum functionality
 Navigation between category “Pomôcky” and different categories
 API integrations 

5. Approach
  
  5.1 Testing Levels:
    E2E Testing: Simulation of real user scenarios, verification of website workflows. 
    Integration system testing: Testing will include user interaction with calculators, navigation and data display.
   Compatibility testing: Simulating display on different devices using Android and iOS. 

  5.2 Testing Types:
    Functional Testing: Verify each feature against requirements.
    Non-functional Testing: Verify each feature is accessible and performs well.
    Compatibility testing: Verify the visual display on devices by simulating devices. 

  5.3 Test Design Techniques:
    Black-box testing for accessibility of features.
    Automation testing using Cypress for regression and integration verification.
    Compatibility testing using chrome extension

6. Item Pass/Fail Criteria
  All automated test cases must pass without critical defects.
  No high-severity bugs should remain unresolved.
  All subcategories must be accessible on mobile devices.
7. Suspension Criteria and Resumption Requirements
  Automated testing will not be suspended if critical bugs are found.
  Manual testing will not be suspended if critical bugs are found.
